# TLCAIR_Tasks

This page includes the code used to answer Task 1 in a JupyterNotebook. All visualizations created are exported as an html file. If you download it and deploy it locally, you can use the interactivity in the visualization. 

There are two forms of visulization: 
1. color-coded by company: you can choose the company in the histogram to highlight the daily reports for that specific company.
2. time-series plot: you can choose the interval you want to focus on and there is a drop-down menu to choose the company.

There is also a spreadsheet of all the data aggregated in two different formats of a pivot table.
